One of the guidelines from the seminal book by Robert Bringhurt - "The 
Elements of Typographic Style" states that "In heads and titles, use the
best ampersand available". This plugin attempts to allow you to do just 
that with your text on the web.

To use this plugin, wrap anything you want to be processed by it between the 
following tag pairs. Entry titles and headline text works best.

{exp:sb_betteramp}{title}{/exp:sb_betteramp}
